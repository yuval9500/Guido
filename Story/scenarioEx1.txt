Baldude$ Hey, are you coming to the party tonight?
Player$ I don’t know. I’m not feeling it.
Baldude$ Oh, come on, it'll be fun. You always say that.
Player$ I know, but I’m really tired today.
Baldude$ Just for a little while? You won’t regret it.
Player$ I guess… but if it’s boring, I’m leaving early.
Baldude$ Deal! I’ll pick you up at seven.
Player$ Fine, fine. I’ll be ready.
