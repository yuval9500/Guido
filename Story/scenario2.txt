Tim$ So, what are you going to wear?
Player$ I haven’t decided yet. Probably something casual.
Tim$ You always look good in casual clothes.
Player$ Thanks! What about you?
Tim$ Oh, I’m going all out. Might as well make an impression.
Player$ Oh wow, I can’t wait to see!
Tim$ Trust me, it’s going to be epic.
Player$ Just don’t upstage the host, okay?
Tim$ No promises.
