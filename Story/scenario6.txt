Lysander the Swift$ Why are you running, and why is he frozen?
Jalisa$ I don't know... what do you want from me? You killed my husband!
Lysander the Swift$ Oops. Anyway, what's on the other side of the tunnel?
Jalisa$ How did you get past the dire wolves outside?
Lysander the Swift$ Dire wolves? We didn’t see any dire wolves.
Jalisa$ My husband and I almost died to them.
Lysander the Swift$ Can you tell me what's on the other side?
Jalisa$ I can show you—just take me with you.
Pyrrhus the Bold$ N... n... no! DIE!
Lysander the Swift$ Why did you kill her?
Pyrrhus the Bold$ She froze me!
Lysander the Swift$ Oh... well, let's keep going.
Pyrrhus the Bold$ Wh... wh... which tunnel?
Lysander the Swift$ Right is always right.
