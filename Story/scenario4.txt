Lysander the Swift$ Hey, I have an idea.
Lysander the Swift$ Let's take him with us.
Pyrrhus the Bold$ A.... a... are you sure?
Lysander the Swift$ Let's take him with us to the mountain.
Lysander the Swift$ And spread his ashes on top of the mountain.
Lysander the Swift$ I'm sure he'll love it.
Lysander the Swift$ And, you know, if it's necessary, I guess we can go and take the dragon's hoardâ€”but only if it's necessary.
Pyrrhus the Bold$ That sa....sa... sounds like a plan.
